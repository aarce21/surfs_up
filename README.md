# Surfs_Up
# Overview
The purpose of the surfs up analysis is to determine weather patters in the months of June and December in Oahu to see if an ice cream and surf rental business will be successful throughout the year or only in certain months. Our goal was to determine temperature trends in June and December and gather statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and minimum and maximum temperature from the data to see how the weather changes throughout the month. This analysis will help determine if one part of the year is more suitable for the business or if the selected location will bring in customers consistently over the year.
