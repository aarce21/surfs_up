# Surfs Up
# Overview
The purpose of the surfs up analysis is to determine weather patters in the months of June and December in Oahu to see if an ice cream and surf rental business will be successful throughout the year or only in certain months. Our goal was to determine temperature trends in June and December and gather statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and minimum and maximum temperature from the data to see how the weather changes throughout the month. This analysis will help determine if the selected location will bring in customers consistently over the year based on weather parameters. 
# Results
After running the analysis to gather statistics on the June and December temperature, we are able to come to a few conclusions based on the tables seen below.

1. The maximum temperature recorded in June and December only differs by two degrees, a max of 85 degrees in June and 83 degrees in December. There is also not a large diffeence between the minimum temperature for both months. The minimum in June reads 64 degrees and 56 degrees in December, only a twelve degree difference between the two months. 
2. The average temperature recorded in June and December is within a five degree difference from one another. The two months show very similar average temperatures, indicating that there is not a huge temperature range difference in the two months. 
3. The standard deviations for June and December are also very similar. This indicates that the temperatures for both June and December follow similar patterns around the average temperature for the month. 

# Summary
The analysis on the temperaure in June and December in Oahu for an ice cream and surf shack has showed us that there is not a large temperature difference throughout the year and that Oahu would be an excellent location for this business. However, there are other parameters besides weather that should be taken into account before opening the business. Additional queries that can be ran to gather a better understanding of the weather in June and December are to look at the precipitation data for the two months. 

Seen below are the precipitation dataframe and descriptive statistics for the month of June.

Both June and December show low levels of precipitation and are very similar to one another. The precipitation data tells us that rainfall throughout the year is fairly consistent and the area does not see large amounts of rain. This is great news for the surf and ice cream shop. Between the data for the temperature and the precipitation in June and December, we can see that Oahu would be an ideal location for the business.
